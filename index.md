## Introduction

Power outages are costly disruptions that can stem from various causes, ranging from severe weather to technical failures. Understanding the relationships between the *cause* of an outage and its *impact*, both in terms of restoration time and number of customers affected, is vital for both policymakers and utility companies.

This project investigates the question of **how different aspects of an outage (e.g., weather vs. technical failure) impact the restoration time**

The dataset spans major U.S. power outages from 2000 to 2016 and contains detailed outage characteristics including cause, duration, geographic metadata, and economic indicators.

- **Rows**: ~1,500 outage events  
- **Relevant Columns**
  - **`outage.start.date`**: The date that the outage started.
  - **`outage.start.date`**: The time that the outage started.
  - **`u.s._state`**: Full name of the U.S. state where the outage occurred.
  - **`postal.code`**: State-level postal code abbreviation (e.g. MI, CA).
  - **`nerc.region`**: NERC (North American Electric Reliability Corporation) reliability region associated with the outage.
  - **`climate.region`**: Climate region classification based on geography (e.g. Southeast, Northwest).
  - **`anomaly.level`**: A numerical indicator of how abnormal the weather was relative to historical averages.
  - **`climate.category`**: Broader climate category classification used in the dataset.
  - **`hurricane.names`**: Name of the hurricane associated with the outage, if any.
  - **`cause.category`**: High-level classification of outage cause (e.g. Severe Weather, Equipment Failure).
  - **`cause.category.detail`**: More specific cause label (e.g. Lightning, Thunderstorm, Vandalism).
  - **`demand.loss.mw`**: The megawatts of electricity demand lost during the outage.
  - **`population`**: Total population in the affected area.
  - **`popden_urban`**: Urban population density (people per square mile).
  - **`popden_rural`**: Rural population density (people per square mile).
  - **`poppct_urban`**: Percentage of the local population living in urban areas.

## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

### Data Cleaning

#### Data Cleaning Process

The data cleaning process involved several key steps to prepare the outage dataset for analysis:

1. First, all column names were standardized to lowercase to ensure consistency and simplify referencing.
2. Next, the datasetâ€™s separate date and time fields for the start and end of outages were combined and converted into proper datetime objects. This allowed for precise time-based calculations.
3. Using these timestamps, the outage duration for each record was calculated by taking the difference between the restoration time and the start time. This duration was stored both as a full time interval and as a simplified count of days.

These transformations enabled accurate modeling and analysis of outage lengths and time-related patterns in the data.

### Univariate Analysis

We began by visualizing the distribution of outage durations:

<iframe src="assets/plots/univar/Outage_Duration_700x350.html" width="700" height="350" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

Outages typically last under 3 days, though long tails exist due to extreme events.

We also looked at how outages are distributed over time:

<iframe src="assets/plots/univar/Power_Outages_by_Year_700x350.html" width="700" height="350" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
<iframe src="assets/plots/univar/Average_Outage_Duration_by_Month_700x350.html" width="700" height="350" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

Outage frequency peaks in summer, likely reflecting storm seasons, while average duration spikes in winter--potentially due to ice storms and slower repairs.

### Bivariate Analysis

To examine cause-specific impacts:

<iframe src="assets/plots/bivar/Outage_Duration_by_Cause_Category_700x350.html" width="700" height="350" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

Weather-related outages generally have higher durations than equipment failures or intentional attacks.

We also explored how outage causes vary over time and geography:

<iframe src="assets/plots/bivar/Distribution_of_Each_Cause_Category_by_Month_pct_700x350.html" width="700" height="350" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
<iframe src="assets/plots/bivar/Distribution_of_Each_Cause_Category_by_Climate_Region_pct_700x350.html" width="700" height="350" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
<iframe src="assets/plots/bivar/Distribution_of_Each_Cause_Category_by_Year_pct_700x350.html" width="700" height="350" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

Finally, we visualized how time-of-day and work hours influence outage durations:

<iframe src="assets/plots/bivar/Outage_Duration_Distribution-_Work_Hours_vs_Off_Hours_by_Region_700x350.html" width="700" height="350" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

It looks like outages during off-hours tend to last longer, especially in certain climate zones.

### Aggregated Tables

We aggregated data to understand regional variation in outage impact, which helped us identify which combinations of region and cause led to particularly long or severe outages.

#### Number of Days Affected by Cause and Climate Region

This table shows how many days each climate region was affected by different types of power outage causes. It provides insight into which causes are most frequent across regions. For example, severe weather is consistently a leading cause, especially in the Northeast, Southeast, and Central regions.

#### Number of Customers Affected by Cause and Climate Region

This table tracks the scale of impact by showing the number of customers affected in each climate region for each cause of power outage. It complements the first table by highlighting not just the frequency of outages but the magnitude. For instance, although equipment failures occurred less frequently in the West, they affected a large number of customers, showing the importance of evaluating not just how often events happen, but how severe they are in terms of customer impact.

## Framing a Prediction Problem

### Prediction Problem

We decided to frame a **regression** problem:

> Given all of the data known at the time of the outage, predict the duration of the outage.

This problem has practical importance: better duration forecasts allow for smarter resource allocation and improved communication with customers.

### Evaluation Metrics

Specifically, we predicted the target variable `outage.duration`. To assess model performance, we used **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** and the **Coefficient of Determination ($R^2$)**.

#### Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

RMSE is a widely used metric that measures the average magnitude of the prediction error, with larger errors penalized more heavily due to squaring. It is defined as:

$$
\text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2}
$$

- **Advantages**: RMSE is intuitive and retains the original units of the target variable, making it easy to interpret. It is particularly useful when large errors are undesirable, as it emphasizes them more than metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

#### Coefficient of Determination ($R^2$)

$R^2$ measures how well the model explains the variability of the target variable:

$$
R^2 = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \bar{y})^2}
$$

- **Advantages**: $R^2$ provides a normalized measure of fit, ranging from 0 (no explanatory power) to 1 (perfect prediction). It complements RMSE by showing how well the model captures overall variance rather than just minimizing error.

Together, RMSE and $R^2$ offer a comprehensive view of model performance, with one emphasizing prediction error magnitude, and the other explaining variance captured.

## Baseline Model

### Model Selection

### Model Choice: Gradient Boosting Regressor

I selected a **Gradient Boosting Regressor** for this task due to its strong performance on structured, tabular datasets and its ability to model complex nonlinear relationships. Gradient boosting builds an ensemble of decision trees in a sequential manner, where each new tree corrects the errors of the previous ones. This results in a highly flexible and powerful model capable of capturing subtle patterns in the data.

Given the mix of numeric, categorical, and engineered features (some with high cardinality and others with skewed distributions) gradient boosting offers robustness without requiring extensive feature scaling or transformation. It also handles interactions between variables well, which is important in a dataset where multiple factors (e.g., weather, population, time of day) may jointly influence outage duration.

Additionally, gradient boosting supports feature importance analysis, aiding interpretability and helping identify key drivers of model predictions.

### Feature Selection and Encoding

We selected **21 features** used to predict the target variable: `outage.duration`.

#### Quantitative Features (7)

These features are continuous or count-based. Missing values were imputed using the mean, and values were standardized using `StandardScaler`.

- `year`
- `month`
- `hour`
- `demand.loss.mw`
- `population`
- `popden_urban`
- `popden_rural`

#### Nominal Categorical Features (14)

These features have no intrinsic order. They were encoded using `OneHotEncoder`.

- `season`
- `day_period`
- `is_work_hours`
- `is_weekend`
- `u.s._state`
- `postal.code`
- `nerc.region`
- `climate.region`
- `climate.category`
- `hurricane.names`
- `cause.category`
- `cause.category.detail`
- `poppct_urban`
- `anomaly.level`
  - Note: this feature is technically ordinal, but treating it as such made the MSE increase massively so it was encoded as nominal.

#### Target Variable

- `outage.duration`: The duration of the power outage in hours (regression target -- quantitative).

### Baseline Model Results

#### Parameter Selection

After performing a grid search with 5-fold cross-validation, the baseline modelâ€™s best parameters were:

- `n_estimators`: 200  
- `max_depth`: 3  
- `learning_rate`: 0.05  
- `min_samples_leaf`: 2  
- `min_samples_split`: 2

#### Performance Metrics

- **RMSE:** 103.01
- **$R^2$:** 0.37

#### Performance Visualization

The following plot shows the model performance for outage duration over time, along with the absolute error.

<iframe src="assets/plots/eval/eval_outage_duration_900x800.html" width="900" height="800" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

#### Baseline Model Overall Evaluation

We can see from the plot above that the model tends to fail to predict outlier outage events, which suggests that there is an extraneous variable influencing the outage duration that is not given in our dataset. This is also supported by the low $R^2$, which suggests that the variance of the actual outage duration is not captured by the prediction model.

That being said, for the majority of outages the model's performance is decent. Overall, we think that this model's performance is good.

## Final Model

After evaluating several modeling options, we retained the **Gradient Boosting Regressor** in the final pipeline due to its superior performance on key evaluation metrics, particularly RMSE and $R^2$. Despite some limitations in capturing all variance (as reflected in a lower $R^2$), the model consistently delivered low absolute prediction error, indicating strong predictive utility.

Gradient boosting effectively handled the datasetâ€™s mix of numeric and categorical features, including engineered variables with skewed distributions and nonlinear effects. Its ability to model complex interactions between features made it especially well-suited to this multifactorial problem.

### Engineered Features

| Feature Name        | Description                                              | Justification                                                                                   |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `year_offset`       | Relative year from a baseline (e.g., 2000)               | Captures long-term trends while avoiding large raw year values that can distort learning.       |
| `had_hurricane`     | Binary flag for presence of a hurricane                  | Simplifies hurricane data and highlights its potential impact on outages.                       |
| `cause_combined`    | Combined category of general and detailed cause          | Encodes richer information while reducing redundancy between related categorical features.      |
| `popden_diff`       | Urban minus rural population density                     | Reflects demographic imbalance that may influence infrastructure vulnerability.                 |
| `demand_loss_log`   | Log-transformed demand loss (in megawatts)               | Mitigates skew and reduces sensitivity to large outliers in demand loss data.                   |
| `is_peak_hour`      | Binary indicator for peak electricity usage hours        | Helps model learn time-sensitive behavior, especially around demand and response prioritization.|

### Final Model Results

The same model, model architecture, hyperparameter grid, and preprocessing steps were used as in the baseline model.

#### Parameter Selection

After performing a grid search with 5-fold cross-validation, the final modelâ€™s best parameters were:

- `n_estimators`: 200  
- `max_depth`: 3  
- `learning_rate`: 0.05  
- `min_samples_leaf`: 2  
- `min_samples_split`: 5 (**changed from baseline model**)

#### Performance Metrics

- **RMSE:** 102.00
- **$R^2$:** 0.38

#### Performance Visualization

The following plot shows the final model's performance for outage duration over time compared to the baseline model's performance, along with the absolute error as before.

<iframe src="assets/plots/eval/final_model_eval_900x800.html" width="900" height="800" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

#### Final Model Overall Evaluation

The final model is only a slight improvement on the baseline model, with the $R^2$ improving from 0.37 to 0.38 and the RMSE improving from 103 to 102.

That being said, we believe that the added features add additional robustness to the model, and that they will make it more generalizable to unseen data.

## Conclusion

In this project, we set out to understand how the cause of a power outage affects its overall impact--specifically the number of customers affected and the time it takes to restore service. Through a combination of exploratory analysis and predictive modeling, we found that outages caused by severe weather tend to be more disruptive and longer-lasting than those from technical failures or other sources.

We trained a regression model to predict outage duration using only information that would be available at the time the outage begins. Our baseline model already showed reasonable performance, but after engineering a few additional features, like whether a hurricane was involved or how urban the affected area was. With these added features, we were able to reduce the prediction error even further.

While thereâ€™s still plenty of room for improvement, this project shows that itâ€™s possible to make meaningful predictions about outage duration using static metadata alone. That kind of insight could be valuable for improving communication with customers and planning emergency responses more effectively.
